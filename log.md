# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: July 19, 2017 
**Today's Progress**: i was faced with a situation at work
where i needed to identify ports with a registration failure and then manually lock them.
I used python.
I learnt how to use open(), For - in loop to read a file object

**Thoughts:** It was a simple program at the end but i did struggle, was worth it -- working

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts**: I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.
